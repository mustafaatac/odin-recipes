    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sarma, a beloved Turkish classic, features grape leaves wrapped around a flavorful filling of rice, herbs, and
            spices. With hints of dill, parsley, and lemon, it’s a perfect balance of zesty and savory flavors, enjoyed warm
            with yogurt or cold as a mezze.</p>
        <p>What makes Sarma special is the care in its preparation, often made together with family. This timeless dish is more
            than food – it’s a symbol of Turkish hospitality and tradition, offering a taste of culture in every bite.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>For the Filling</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>⅔ cup short-grain rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>½ bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ bunch fresh dill, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried mint</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>For Assembly</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>40 fresh or jarred grape leaves, rinsed and stems removed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>First, brined grape leaves are soaked in hot water for 2-3 minutes, rinsed, and drained in a colander.</li>
        <li>Next, onions are grated into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Olive oil is poured over the onions.</li>
        <li>Washed rice is added to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Spices, tomato paste, and salt are incorporated, followed by finely chopped parsley, and the mixture is stirred well
            (the filling will be raw).</li>
        <li>A small amount of the filling is placed on the wide part of the grape leaf, which is then rolled like a cylinder,
            folding the sides inward to secure the filling.</li>
        <li>This process is repeated until all grape leaves are used.</li>
        <li>The rolled grape leaves are placed in a pot. Olive oil and lemon slices are added on top.</li>
        <li>Hot water is poured into the pot until it slightly covers the rolls.</li>
        <li>To prevent the rolls from unrolling, a plate smaller than the pot is placed on top of the grape leaves.</li>
        <li>The Sarma is cooked over low heat until the filling is tender.</li>
      </ol>
