    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sarma, a beloved Turkish classic, features grape leaves wrapped around a flavorful filling of rice, herbs, and
            spices. With hints of dill, parsley, and lemon, it’s a perfect balance of zesty and savory flavors, enjoyed warm
            with yogurt or cold as a mezze.</p>
        <p>What makes Sarma special is the care in its preparation, often made together with family. This timeless dish is more
            than food – it’s a symbol of Turkish hospitality and tradition, offering a taste of culture in every bite.</p>
