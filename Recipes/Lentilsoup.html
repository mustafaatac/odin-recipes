  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup red lentils (washed and drained)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot (peeled and chopped)</li>
        <li>1 medium potato (peeled and chopped)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>5 cups water or vegetable broth (adjust for desired consistency)</li>
        <li>Juice of half a lemon (for serving)</li>
        <li>Optional: Red pepper flakes or dried mint (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Ingredients:
            Wash the red lentils thoroughly and drain them.
            Chop the onion, carrot, and potato into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Sauté the Base:
            Heat olive oil or butter in a large pot over medium heat.
            Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened and translucent.
            Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another 1-2 minutes to enhance its flavor.</li>
        <li>Add the Vegetables and Lentils:
            Add the chopped carrot, potato, and red lentils to the pot. Stir to combine everything well.</li>
        <li>Add Liquid and Seasonings:
            Pour in the water or vegetable broth and stir.
            Add cumin, paprika, and salt. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Cook the Soup:
            Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or
            until the lentils and vegetables are soft and tender.</li>
        <li>Blend the Soup:
            Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth and creamy. Alternatively, you can transfer it to a regular
            blender in batches, then return it to the pot.</li>
        <li>Adjust Consistency:
            If the soup is too thick, add a bit more water or broth until it reaches your desired consistency. Simmer for another
            2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve:

            Ladle the soup into bowls. Drizzle with fresh lemon juice and garnish with red pepper flakes or dried mint if desired.
            Serve warm with crusty bread on the side.</li>
    </ol>
