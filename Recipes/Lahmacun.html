      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups of flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of dry yeast</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of warm water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
          </ul>
        
        <h3>For the Topping:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>250 grams of minced meat (preferably fatty lamb or beef)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion (finely chopped or grated)</li>
            <li>1 tomato (grated)</li>
            <li>1 green and red pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of pepper paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of parsley (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove (optional, finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of cumin</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons of olive oil or water (to make the mixture smoother)</li>
         </ul>  

      <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Add the red peppers, green peppers, onions, and tomatoes to a food processor.</li>
            <li>Blend them until they are chopped finely, but not completely pureed.</li>
            <li>Mix in the tomato paste, pepper paste, olive oil, and water. Finally, add the minced meat and mix everything
                thoroughly. For a flavorful Lahmacun, the mixture should have a slightly runny consistency. If it’s too thick, you
                can add a little more water.</li>
            <li>If you have time, let the mixture rest in the refrigerator for a while.</li>
            <li>While the mixture is resting, start preparing the dough. Pour the water into a bowl, add the salt and sugar, and mix
                well. Gradually add flour and knead until the dough reaches a medium-firm consistency.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into a cylinder and divide it into equal portions. To ensure all Lahmacuns are the same size, make
                sure each dough ball weighs the same. Let the dough balls rest for a while.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough balls to the size of a dinner plate. It’s important to roll them as thin as possible. Meanwhile,
                preheat your oven to 250°C (482°F) with the fan on and the top and bottom heat settings active. Let the oven heat up
                properly.</li>
            <li>Spread the minced meat mixture evenly over the rolled-out dough. Place them on the bottom rack of the oven along
                with parchment paper and bake for 7-10 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown.</li>
         </ol>
